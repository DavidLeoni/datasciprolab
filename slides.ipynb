    "#### Python Tutor\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's meet Python on the web with [Python Tutor](http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html) is a great way to visualize Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use it as much as possible!** . It really provides great guidance about how things are working under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default works for standard Python code. If you want to use it also with code from modules (i.e.  numpy) you have to select `Write code in Python3 with Anaconda (experimental)` \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "Distribution of Python + many libraries (i.e. numpy) + applications (i.e. Jupyter)\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda Python 3.6  https://www.anaconda.com/download\n",
    "(during installation, when asked install also Visual Studio Code)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Console\n",
    "\n",
    "If you run `Anaconda Prompt`, you will see the system console. \n",
    "\n",
    "In system console:\n",
    "- to see files of the folder you are in you can type `dir` in windows and `ls` in Mac/Linx\n",
    "- to enter a folder: `cd MYFOLDER`\n",
    "- to leave a folder: `cd ..'\n",
    "    - mind the space between cd and two dots\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "From system console, run \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "You will see the python interpreter (the one with `>>>`), where you can directly issue commands and see the output. \n",
    "If for some reason it doesn't work, try running \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "WARNING: you must be running Python 3, in this course we only use that version !\n",
    "\n",
    "WARNING: if you take random code from the internet, be sure it is for Python **3** \n",
    "\n",
    "WARNING: the `>>>` is there just to tell you you are looking at python interpreter. It is *not* python code ! If you find written `>>>` in some code example , do not copy it !\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "Handy program to write notebooks organized in cells (files with `.ipynb` extension), where there is both code, output of running that code and text. The code by default is Python, but can also be other languages like R). The text is formatted with [Markdown language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) - see [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). It's becoming the de-facto standard for writing technical documentation (you can find everywhere, i.e. blogs). \n",
    " \n",
    "To run it: \n",
    "\n",
    "Launch Anaconda Navigator, and then search and run Jupyter. A Jupyter server will start, and then an internet browser should open. Remember Jupyter is a server, what you see in the browser is just the UI which is connecting to the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "- when something seem wrong in computations, try to clean memory by running `Kernel->Restart and Run all`\n",
    "- when you see an asterisk to the side of a cell, maybe the computationg has hanged (an infinite while?). To solve the problem, run `Kernel->shutdown` and then `Kernel -> restart`\n",
    "\n",
    "Other useful keys: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Control + Enter: only executes current cell without going to next one\n",
    "- Shift + Enter: Executes cell and goes to the next one\n",
    "- Alt + Enter: executes cell and creates a new cell afterwards\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### IDE \n",
    "\n",
    "As editor for regular Python files (which are text files ending in `.py`) you can use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "- open source\n",
    "- lightweight\n",
    "- used by many developers\n",
    "- Python plugin is not the best, but works enough for us\n",
