    "#### Python Tutor\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's meet Python on the web with [Python Tutor](http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html) is a great way to visualize Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use it as much as possible!** . It really provides great guidance about how things are working under the hood.\n",

    "By default works for standard Python code. If you want to use it also with code from modules (i.e.  numpy) you have to select `Write code in Python3 with Anaconda (experimental)` \n",

    "#### Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "Handy program to write notebooks organized in cells (files with `.ipynb` extension), where there is both code, output of running that code and text. The code by default is Python, but can also be other languages like R). The text is formatted with [Markdown language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) - see [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). It's becoming the de-facto standard for writing technical documentation (you can find everywhere, i.e. blogs). \n",

    "\n",
    "Launch Anaconda Navigator, and then search and run Jupyter. A Jupyter server will start, and then an internet browser should open. Remember Jupyter is a server, what you see in the browser is just the UI which is connecting to the server.\n",

    "- when something seem wrong in computations, try to clean memory by running `Kernel->Restart and Run all`\n",
    "- when you see an asterisk to the side of a cell, maybe the computationg has hanged (an infinite while?). To solve the problem, run `Kernel->shutdown` and then `Kernel -> restart`\n",
