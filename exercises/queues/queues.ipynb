    "* elements are inserted at the position pointed to by `(_head + _size) % capacity()`, and dequeued from position pointed by `_head`. The module `%` operator allows using a list as it were circular, that is, if an index apparently falls outside the list, with the modulus it gets transformed to a small index. Since `_size` can never exceed `capacity()`,  the formula `(_head + _size) % capacity()` never points to a place which could overwrite elements not yet dequeued, except cases when the queue has `_size==0` or `_size==capacity()` which are to be treated as special.\n",
