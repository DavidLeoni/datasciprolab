    "## 4. v4 Go bidirectional\n",
    "\n",
    "Our list so far has links that allow us to traverse it fast in one direction. But what if we want fast traversal in the reverse direction, from last to first element? What if we want a `pop()` that works in $O(1)$ ? To speed up these operations we could add  backward links to each `Node`. Note no solution is provided for this part (yet).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Proceed in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Save your work \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you're done with previous points, save the version you have in a folder `linked-list-v3` somewhere adding in the `README.txt` comments about the improvements done so far, the version number (like 3.0) and the date. Then start working on a new copy. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Node backlinks\n",
    "\n",
    "In `Node` class, add backlinks by adding the attribute `_prev` and methods `get_prev(self)` and `set_prev(self, pointer)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Better __str__\n",
    "\n",
    "Improve `__str__` method so it shows presence or absence of links, along with the size of the list (note you might need to adapt the test for str method):\n",
    "\n",
    "* `next` pointers presence must be represented with `>` character , absence with `*` character. They must be put after the item representation. \n",
    "* `prev` pointers presence must be represented with `<` character , absence with `*` character. They must be put befor the item representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for the list `['a','b','c']`, you would have the following representation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "LinkedList(size=3):*a><b><c*  \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As a special case for empty list you should print the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "LinkedList(size=0):[]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Other examples of proper lists, with 3, 2, and 1 element can be: \n",
    "```\n",
    "LinkedList(size=3):*a><b><c*  \n",
    "LinkedList(size=2):*a><b*\n",
    "LinkedList(size=1):*a*\n",
    "```\n",
    "This new `__str__` method should help you to spot broken lists like the following, were some pointers are not correct:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Broken list, all prev pointers are missing:\n",
    "LinkedList(size=3):*a>*b>*c*\n",
    "\n",
    "Broken list, size = 3 but shows only one element with next pointer set to None:\n",
    "LinkedList(size=3):*a*\n",
    "\n",
    "Broken list, first backward pointer points to something other than None \n",
    "LinkedList(size=3):<a>*b*<c*\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.4 Modify add()\n",
    "\n",
    "Update the `LinkedList` `add` method to take into account you now have backlinks. Take particular care for the boundary cases when the list is empty, has one element, or for nodes at the head and at the tail of the list.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### 4.5  Add to_python_reversed()\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement `to_python_reversed` method with a linear scan by using the newly added backlinks:\n",
    "        \n",
    "```python\n",
    "    def to_python_reversed(self):\n",
    "        \"\"\" Returns a regular Python list with the elements in reverse order,\n",
    "            from last to first. Since v3. \"\"\"\n",
    "        raise Exception(\"TODO implement me\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "  Add also this test, and make sure it pass:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    def test_to_python_reversed(self):    \n",
    "        ul = LinkedList()\n",
    "        ul.add('c')\n",
    "        ul.add('b')\n",
    "        ul.add('a')\n",
    "        pr = to_py(ul)\n",
    "        pr.reverse()  # we are reversing pr with Python's 'reverse()' method\n",
    "        self.assertEquals(pr, ul.to_python_reversed())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.6 Add invariant\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the method `to_python_reversed()`, add a new invariant to the `myAssert` method. If implemented correctly, this will surely spot a lot of possible errors in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.7 Modify other methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Modify all other methods that mutate the data structure (`insert`, `remove`, etc) so that they update the backward links properly. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.8 Run the tests\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wrote meaningful tests and all pass, congrats!\n"
